# SwingGroove Golf – Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-10-01

This Privacy Policy explains how SwingGroove Golf (the "App") handles information. We designed the App to be simple and privacy‑respecting.

## Summary
- We do not create user accounts.
- We do not collect, sell, or share personal information directly.
- The App shows banner ads (Google Mobile Ads/AdMob) and offers a one‑time in‑app purchase to remove ads. These third‑party services may process limited data to provide their functionality.

## Information we collect
We do not collect or store personal information on our own servers.

## Third‑party services
The App integrates the following services. Their processing is governed by their own policies.

- **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)** – serves in‑app banner ads on iOS and Android. AdMob and its partners may process device information (e.g., device identifiers/Advertising ID, IP address, coarse location), ad performance data, and diagnostic information to deliver and measure ads. Where required (e.g., in the EU/UK), the app may show a consent form via User Messaging Platform (UMP).
  - Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
  - AdMob Policy: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543
  - iOS: manage tracking and ad preferences in Settings (e.g., “Allow Apps to Request to Track”).
  - Android: manage Ads personalization and reset the Advertising ID in device Settings.

- **Apple App Store / StoreKit (In‑App Purchases, iOS)** – enables the one‑time purchase to remove ads. Apple may process transaction‑related and device information to complete billing and fraud prevention.
  - Apple Privacy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/

- **Google Play Billing (In‑App Purchases, Android)** – enables the one‑time purchase to remove ads. Google may process transaction‑related and device information to complete billing and fraud prevention.
  - Google Play Terms & Privacy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

- **Operating system services (iOS and Android)** – The operating system may collect crash or diagnostic data that can be shared with the developer if you opt in via system settings.

## Data retention
- The App itself does not retain personal data.
- Third‑party services may retain data per their policies.

## Children’s privacy
The App is intended for general audiences. AdMob policies and platform rules apply; we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through a third‑party service, please refer to that service’s removal process.

## Security
We minimize data handling by not operating our own backend. Third‑party services apply their own security measures.

## Your choices
- You may remove ads permanently via the in‑app purchase.
- You can manage platform privacy settings in device Settings:
  - iOS: advertising/tracking preferences (e.g., “Allow Apps to Request to Track”).
  - Android: Ads personalization and reset Advertising ID.
- Where shown, you can update ads consent via the in‑app consent dialog (UMP).
- You can uninstall the App at any time.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy for legal, technical, or operational reasons. Material changes will be reflected in this file with a new effective date.
