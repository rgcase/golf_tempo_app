# Ads and Privacy (AdMob + UMP)

This app uses a bottom banner ad. During development, use Google test unit IDs. For production, configure real AdMob IDs and consent.

## Package
- `google_mobile_ads`

## Initialization
- Initialize MobileAds early (e.g., in app start) and load a `BannerAd` on the Home screen.
- During development use test unit IDs from Googleâ€™s docs.

## Platform config
- iOS: add the AdMob app ID in [ios/Runner/Info.plist](mdc:ios/Runner/Info.plist)
- Android: add the AdMob app ID in [android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml](mdc:android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml)

## Consent (EEA)
- Implement UMP (User Messaging Platform) to collect consent when required.
- Show the consent form at startup if needed; store and respect the choice.

## Privacy policy
- Publish a simple privacy policy covering AdMob data usage at [docs/privacy.html](mdc:docs/privacy.html) and link it from the store listings.

## UX notes
- Keep the banner within a `SafeArea`; avoid overlapping primary controls.
- Show banner only on the main screen to reduce clutter.
