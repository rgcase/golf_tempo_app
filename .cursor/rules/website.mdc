# Website (GitHub Pages)

A minimal static site is required mainly for the privacy policy and a landing page.

## Structure
- Root for Pages: `docs/`
  - [docs/index.html](mdc:docs/index.html) – app name, description, screenshots, store links, contact
  - [docs/privacy.html](mdc:docs/privacy.html) – privacy policy (AdMob data usage)
  - [docs/styles.css](mdc:docs/styles.css) – optional simple styling

## Notes
- Enable GitHub Pages on the repository using the `docs/` folder.
- Keep content lightweight; optimize for mobile viewing.
- Add badges/links to App Store and Google Play once available.

See: Ads and Privacy rule for required disclosures.
