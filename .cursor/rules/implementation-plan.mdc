# Implementation Plan and Milestones

This app guides golf swing tempo by playing 3 tones on repeat at configurable tempos. Two core ratios: 3:1 (full swing, e.g., 21:7) and 2:1 (short game/putting).

## Milestones
1. Setup
   - Add packages: `flutter_riverpod`, `just_audio`, `audio_session`, `wakelock_plus`, `vibration`, `google_mobile_ads`.
   - Establish folder structure under `lib/` (see Project Structure rule).
2. Audio engine
   - Add 3 beep assets (`assets/audio/`), wire precise loop using `just_audio` + `SilenceAudioSource`.
   - Keep screen awake during playback; configure `audio_session`.
3. UI v1
   - Home screen: ratio toggle (3:1/2:1), preset chips (e.g., 21:7), tempo slider, Start/Stop, volume, haptics toggle.
   - Persist preferences locally.
4. Ads
   - Banner ad using `google_mobile_ads` with test IDs; SafeArea layout.
   - Consent (UMP) for EEA.
5. Website
   - `docs/` with landing and privacy policy for AdMob.
6. License & repo polish
   - Add source-available license permitting personal use only; add README with build instructions.

## Defaults
- Presets (3:1): 18/6, 21/7, 24/8, 27/9. Presets (2:1): 12/6, 16/8, 20/10.
- Beeps: ~50–70ms; pitches ≈ 550/750/1000 Hz.
- Dark theme, green accent; no pause between cycles initially.

## Next tasks (short list)
- Add packages to [pubspec.yaml](mdc:pubspec.yaml) and fetch.
- Create `lib/audio/audio_engine.dart` with a gapless sequence for three tones.
- Create `assets/audio/` and register assets.
- Replace scaffold in [lib/main.dart](mdc:lib/main.dart) with Home screen and layout area for a banner ad.
