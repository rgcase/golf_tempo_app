# Implementation Plan and Milestones

This app guides golf swing tempo by playing 3 tones in a repeating cycle at configurable tempos. Two core ratios: 3:1 (full swing, e.g., 21:7) and 2:1 (short game/putting).

## Milestones
1. Setup
   - Add packages: `just_audio`, `audio_session`, `wakelock_plus`, `vibration`.
   - Establish folder structure under `lib/` (see Project Structure rule).
2. Audio engine
   - Pre-generate cycle WAVs (no embedded gap) using [tools/generate_audio.dart](mdc:tools/generate_audio.dart):
     - 3:1: 18/6, 21/7, 24/8, 27/9
     - 2:1: 12/6, 16/8, 20/10
   - Bundle under [assets/audio/cycles/](mdc:assets/audio/cycles/.gitkeep) and register in [pubspec.yaml](mdc:pubspec.yaml).
   - At runtime: load the appropriate asset and play once with loop mode off; on completion, wait a configurable gap and restart from the beginning (event-driven relaunch with a timer). This makes the between-cycle gap adjustable at runtime.
3. UI v1
   - Single-screen UI using `setState`: ratio toggle, Start/Stop.
   - Future: presets UI, volume slider, haptics toggle, keep-awake, and a control for the gap between cycles.
4. Website
   - `docs/` with landing and privacy policy (for future ads if added).
5. License & repo polish
   - Add source-available license permitting personal use only; add README with build instructions.

## Defaults
- Presets (3:1): 18/6, 21/7, 24/8, 27/9. Presets (2:1): 12/6, 16/8, 20/10.
- Beeps: ~60ms; pitches â‰ˆ 550/750/1000 Hz; envelope for clicky attack (applied at generation time).
- Dark theme, green accent.
- Default gap between cycles: 2s (runtime configurable).

## Next tasks (short list)
- Generate assets: `dart run tools/generate_audio.dart`, then `flutter pub get`.
- Ensure `AudioEngine` plays a single cycle with loop mode off and relaunches after the configured gap.
- Add a UI control for gap selection (chips or slider).

Notes
- Ads are currently removed; revisit after core UX is stable.
- If adding new presets, regenerate audio assets and update the UI mapping accordingly.
